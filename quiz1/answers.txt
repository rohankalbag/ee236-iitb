part(a)

Feature,1N914,1N34A
Turnon Voltage considering 10mA current as forward turnon current, 0.4V, 0.74V
Reverse Voltage,behaving like no reverse breakdown,-0.2V 
Reverse Current, 0uA, -2.6uA

reason for difference is that the diodes have different doping densities  in the p and n regions and hence accordingly different values of Vbi and VRb

part(b)

We see that the values are increasing with temperature
